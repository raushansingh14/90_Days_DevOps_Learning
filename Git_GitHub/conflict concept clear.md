## note after resolving the conflict manually no need to again run `git merger` just do `git add` and after that `git commit -m "some message" ` . these command should be run where you doing merge lets say if you doing 
  merge in master then only in master 

  Once you resolved the conflict content of file will only changed in master branch because there you doing merge . content of feature branch file will be intact
