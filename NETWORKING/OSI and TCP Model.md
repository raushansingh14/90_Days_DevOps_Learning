# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) Models


The OSI model was developed by ISO (International Standards Organization) in the 1980s as a theoretical model to standardize communication.It has 7 layers, 
each with a specific role. 
 
## OSI Layers (Top to Bottom):
- | Layer Number | Layer Name                     | Function                                                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4            | **Application**                | Combines OSI's application, presentation, and session layers                 |
| 3            | **Transport**                  | Responsible for reliable/unreliable transmission (TCP/UDP)                  |
| 2            | **Internet**                   | Responsible for logical addressing and routing (IP, ICMP)                   |
| 1            | **Network Access** (or Link Layer) | Combines OSI's data link and physical layers                          |
