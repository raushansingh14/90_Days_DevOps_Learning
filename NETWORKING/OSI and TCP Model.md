# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) Models

## OSI Model

- The OSI model was developed by ISO (International Standards Organization) in the 1980s as a theoretical model to standardize communication.It has 7 layers, 
each with a specific role. It is a conceptual framework that helps us understand how data moves across a network.
- Mostly used for teaching, not practical implementation
- Doesnâ€™t specify protocols
- Protocol-independent

 ## TCP/IP Model
 
- TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.It is the practical model used in real-world networking, especially on the Internet. Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense
- Foundation of the Internet
- Uses standard protocols like TCP, IP, FTP, HTTP
- Protocol-oriented
 


 ### Let me explain how OSI/TCP(/IP) model in laymanâ€™s terms with a real-world example.

## Imagine You Are Sending a Letter (Real-World Example)
Letâ€™s say you want to send a letter to a friend. The OSI model works similarly to how a letter is written, packed, sent, received, and read. Each layer of the OSI model plays a role in this process.


### 1. Physical Layer (Sending the Letter via Postman)
This layer deals with the actual transmission of data in the form of electrical signals, radio waves, or light pulses.

ðŸ“Œ Example: The postman, road, and postal vans that physically carry your letter represent the physical medium of the network.

### 2. Data Link Layer (Ensuring the Letter is Properly Placed in the Envelope)
This layer ensures that data is properly formatted for transmission and that errors are detected.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Just like how you put the letter in an envelope and write your friendâ€™s address, the Data Link Layer packages data into frames and adds MAC addresses (like physical addresses of computers).

### 3. Network Layer (Finding the Best Route for Delivery)
This layer decides the best path for sending data across different networks.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Think of this as the postal system choosing the best route for your letter (by air, train, or road). Similarly, the IP (Internet Protocol) in the network layer finds the best path for sending your data.

### 4. Transport Layer (Ensuring the Letter Reaches the Right Person and is Complete)
This layer ensures that data is delivered error-free, in the right order, and without missing parts.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Imagine your letter is sent in multiple pages, and you need to ensure they arrive in the right order. The transport layer (TCP or UDP) manages this by breaking data into segments and reassembling it correctly at the receiverâ€™s end.

### 5. Session Layer (Starting & Managing the Conversation)
This layer establishes, maintains, and ends communication between devices.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Think of it as a phone call between you and your friendâ€”you need to first connect, talk, and then hang up when done. The session layer handles this connection in a computer network.

### 6. Presentation Layer (Translating the Letter into a Language Your Friend Understands)
This layer translates, encrypts, and compresses data so that the receiving computer can understand it.

ðŸ“Œ Example: If you write the letter in Hindi but your friend understands only English, someone needs to translate it. Similarly, the presentation layer ensures data is in the correct format.

### 7. Application Layer (Your Friend Reading the Letter & Understanding It)
This is the layer where users interact with applications like browsers (Chrome), emails (Gmail), and messaging apps (WhatsApp).

ðŸ“Œ Example: Your friend opens the letter and reads itâ€”this is how applications (like web browsers or email clients) display information to users.
