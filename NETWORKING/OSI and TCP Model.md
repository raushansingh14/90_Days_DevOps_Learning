# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) Models

## OSI Model

- The OSI model was developed by ISO (International Standards Organization) in the 1980s as a theoretical model to standardize communication.It has 7 layers, 
each with a specific role. It is a conceptual framework that helps us understand how data moves across a network.
- Mostly used for teaching, not practical implementation
- Doesnâ€™t specify protocols
- Protocol-independent

 ## TCP/IP Model
 
- TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.It is the practical model used in real-world networking, especially on the Internet. Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense
- Foundation of the Internet
- Uses standard protocols like TCP, IP, FTP, HTTP
- Protocol-oriented
 


 ### Let me explain how OSI/TCP(/IP) model in laymanâ€™s terms with a real-world example.

## Imagine You Are Sending a Letter (Real-World Example)
Letâ€™s say you want to send a letter to a friend. The OSI model works similarly to how a letter is written, packed, sent, received, and read. Each layer of the OSI model plays a role in this process.


### 1. Physical Layer (Sending the Letter via Postman)
This layer deals with the actual transmission of data in the form of electrical signals, radio waves, or light pulses.

ðŸ“Œ Example: The postman, road, and postal vans that physically carry your letter represent the physical medium of the network.

### 2. Data Link Layer (Ensuring the Letter is Properly Placed in the Envelope)
This layer ensures that data is properly formatted for transmission and that errors are detected.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Just like how you put the letter in an envelope and write your friendâ€™s address, the Data Link Layer packages data into frames and adds MAC addresses (like physical addresses of computers).

### 3. Network Layer (Finding the Best Route for Delivery)
This layer decides the best path for sending data across different networks.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Think of this as the postal system choosing the best route for your letter (by air, train, or road). Similarly, the IP (Internet Protocol) in the network layer finds the best path for sending your data.

### 4. Transport Layer (Ensuring the Letter Reaches the Right Person and is Complete)
This layer ensures that data is delivered error-free, in the right order, and without missing parts.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Imagine your letter is sent in multiple pages, and you need to ensure they arrive in the right order. The transport layer (TCP or UDP) manages this by breaking data into segments and reassembling it correctly at the receiverâ€™s end.

### 5. Session Layer (Making a phone call, having conversation and then hanging up)
This layer establishes, maintains, and ends communication between devices.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Think of it as a phone call between you and your friendâ€”you need to first connect, talk, and then hang up when done. The session layer handles this connection in a computer network.

### 6. Presentation Layer (Translating the Letter into a Language Your Friend Understands)
This layer translates, encrypts, and compresses data so that the receiving computer can understand it.

ðŸ“Œ Example: If you write the letter in Hindi but your friend understands only English, someone needs to translate it. Similarly, the presentation layer ensures data is in the correct format.

### 7. Application Layer (Your Friend Reading the Letter & Understanding It)
This is the layer where users interact with applications like browsers (Chrome), emails (Gmail), and messaging apps (WhatsApp).

ðŸ“Œ Example: Your friend opens the letter and reads itâ€”this is how applications (like web browsers or email clients) display information to users.

# Lets say in browser you typed "www.sbi.com"  then how OSI model works

## 1. Application Layer (Layer 7) â€“ You Request a Website
This is where your web browser (Chrome, Firefox) operates.

You type "www.sbi.com" in the browser and hit Enter.

The browser sends a request using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.


ðŸ“Œ Networking Example: The browser acts as the application requesting a webpage from the SBI web server.

## 2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6) â€“ Data Formatting & Encryption

The browser formats the request into a proper format that the SBI web server can understand.

If youâ€™re using HTTPS (secured connection), this layer encrypts the data for security.


ðŸ“Œ Networking Example: SSL/TLS encryption happens here when using HTTPS.

## 3. Session Layer (Layer 5) â€“ Establishing a Connection with SBI Server

Your computer starts a session (a conversation) with SBIâ€™s web server.

It keeps track of the session so multiple requests (like loading images, CSS, JavaScript) donâ€™t get mixed up.

ðŸ“Œ Networking Example: Your browser and SBIâ€™s server establish a secure session (TCP handshake).

## 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4) â€“ Breaking Data into Small Packets

Your request is broken into small segments to be sent over the network.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable delivery.

ðŸ“Œ Networking Example:

TCP ensures each packet reaches the SBI server in the correct order.

If a packet is lost, TCP resends it.

## 5. Network Layer (Layer 3) â€“ Finding the SBI Serverâ€™s IP Address

Your browser doesn't understand www.sbi.com directly.

It sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server, which translates "www.sbi.com" into an IP address (e.g., 103.10.125.2).

Now, your computer knows where to send the request.

ðŸ“Œ Networking Example:

Your request is forwarded through routers, which choose the best path to SBIâ€™s server.

The IP address of the SBI server is used for communication.

## 6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2) â€“ Converting Data into Frames & MAC Addresses

The data is converted into frames with a MAC address (hardware address of your router).

If youâ€™re using Wi-Fi, it will send the request wirelessly; if using Ethernet, it will go through a cable.

ðŸ“Œ Networking Example:

Your Wi-Fi router assigns a MAC address for communication.

The router sends the request towards the SBI web server.

## 7. Physical Layer (Layer 1) â€“ Sending Data as Electrical Signals

The data is transmitted as electrical signals (Ethernet), radio waves (Wi-Fi), or light pulses (fiber-optic cable).

The data physically travels through network cables, switches, routers, and finally reaches the SBI server.

ðŸ“Œ Networking Example:

Your request travels through multiple routers, undersea cables, and networks before reaching SBIâ€™s web server.

## What Happens Next? (Response from SBI Server)

Now, the SBI web server receives your request, processes it, and sends back the websiteâ€™s data in the reverse order:

- SBI server processes the request at the Application Layer.

- Data is formatted and encrypted at the Presentation Layer.

- A session is maintained between your computer and the SBI server.

- The response is broken into TCP segments at the Transport Layer.

- The server's IP address is used to send data back at the Network Layer.

- The data is converted into frames and sent at the Data Link Layer.

- The data travels back to your computer as electrical signals or Wi-Fi signals.

- Your browser receives the webpage, and you see "www.sbi.com" loaded on your screen! ðŸŽ‰
