# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection Model)and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) Models 
The OSI model was developed by ISO (International Standards Organization) in the 1980s as a theoretical model to standardize communication.It has 7 layers, 
 each with a specific role. 
 ðŸ”¹ OSI Layers (Top to Bottom):

Layer Number | Layer Name | Function
7 | Application | Provides services directly to user applications (e.g., browsers, email clients)
6 | Presentation | Translates, encrypts, compresses data (e.g., encoding like JPEG, ASCII)
5 | Session | Manages sessions and connections (e.g., login sessions)
4 | Transport | Provides reliable delivery, error checking, segmentation (e.g., TCP/UDP)
3 | Network | Handles routing, logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses, routers)
2 | Data Link | MAC addressing, frames, error detection (e.g., switches, NICs)
1 | Physical | Physical connection â€” cables, bits, signals (e.g., Ethernet cables)
